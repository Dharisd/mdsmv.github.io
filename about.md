Digitalisation is without a doubt one of the biggest challenges of our time. Instrumental in shaping a better digital society for all involves a deep understanding of the technological drivers of digitalisation. Digitalisation affects the key pillars of our societies: notably health, education, work and island life. A digital society requires robust protection of data, people and human values. What connects these pillars is the development of knowledge and understanding of the issues and technologies, in which interdisciplinary perceptions and methods become the norm instead of the exception.
As such, MDS volunteers to create awareness that would facilitate to create conditions, principles and technology to take on this digital challenge and ensure it will be beneficial for our society.
